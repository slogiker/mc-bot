**Strong rule for this repository**  
**This file (LLM-README.md) and ALL other documentation files (README.md, docs/, INSTALL.md, etc.) MUST be updated BEFORE every commit and push.**  
Outdated or contradictory documentation causes confusion and wastes time. Treat documentation as production code — keep it honest and current.

## One-sentence summary

Self-hosted Discord bot that launches, manages, monitors, backs up and administrates a local Minecraft Java Edition server — designed for small groups of friends who want to easily control their private server from Discord.

## What this project IS vs what it is NOT

| Question                                          | Answer                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Is this a player/AFK/grief/crystal/automation bot? | **No** — it does **not** control any Minecraft client or account       |
| Does it run inside Minecraft (Forge/Fabric mod)?  | **No**                                                                 |
| Is it a chat relay / Discord–Minecraft bridge?    | **Partially** — only for server commands and logs, not full chat relay |
| Does it start and manage the actual server?       | **Yes** — runs `java -jar server.jar` via subprocess                   |
| Target audience                                   | Small friend groups playing casually together on a private server     |
| Suitable for public/anarchy/big servers?          | **No**                                                                 |
| Intended usage                                    | Private server owned by the user, controlled comfortably from Discord  |

## Core concept

Discord slash-command bot + local Minecraft server (same machine or LAN/VPN reachable)  
→ full server lifecycle and rich management features without needing SSH, web panels, or third-party hosting.

## Current main features (already partially working or close)

- `/start` `/stop` `/restart` `/status`
- Live updating embed in `#server-information` channel (online/offline, players, version, join address)
- `/cmd <command>` — executes any server command via RCON
- `/setup` wizard — creates required channels, sets permissions, guides jar + eula placement
- Basic world backup (zip → local or temporary link)
- `/players` — list currently online players
- Whitelist add/remove via Discord

## High-priority / in-progress features (2026 focus)

1. **Live Console Channel** (`#console`)
   - Real-time colored log tail (INFO green, WARN yellow, ERROR red, …)
   - Only owner can send commands there
   - `/cmd` replies appear in thread or as reply

2. **Player statistics** `/stats <player>`
   - Legit players → Mojang API (skin, playtime, deaths, …)
   - Cracked/offline players → parse `.dat` files (nbtlib) + fallback Steve head

3. **Server health monitoring** `/info`
   - CPU / RAM / disk usage (psutil)
   - Rough TPS estimation
   - Low-TPS / high-RAM alerts

4. **Easy backup download**
   - Zip world folder
   - Temporary share link (pyonesend or future custom uploader)
   - Sent via DM

5. **Enhanced /setup**
   - Options: vanilla | fabric | paper | forge-modpack
   - Modrinth API integration → search & auto-download modpacks

6. **Server auto-update** `/update`
   - Backup → download new jar/mods → restart → optional rollback

7. **Event & reminder system**
   - `/event` `/reschedule`
   - Timed reminders (24 h + 1 h) without auto-starting server

8. **Grok-powered fun & utility**
   - `/ai <prompt>` — very short, unhinged answers
   - Auto-memes/roasts on deaths, lag spikes, funny moments (rate-limited)

9. **Lightweight economy**
   - Word hunt mini-game (Grok generates word → first to type wins coins)
   - `/pay` `/economy_set`

10. **Discord ↔ Minecraft player mapping**
    - Store discord_id ↔ mc_uuid / username / cracked flag
    - Show "Steve (@discorduser)" style in embeds

## Technical stack – current state

- Language: Python 3.11+
- Discord library: discord.py (slash commands, tasks, buttons, modals)
- Server process: `subprocess.Popen` → `java -jar server.jar`
- Remote control: RCON (default port 25575)
- Configuration & data:
  - `.env` (tokens, passwords)
  - `config.json` (channels, roles, paths, settings)
  - `data/bot_config.json` (economy, mappings, events, …)
  - `data/user_config.json` (schedules, custom triggers)
- Main dependencies (non-exhaustive):
  - discord.py
  - python-dotenv
  - psutil
  - aiohttp
  - nbtlib (planned)
  - xAI SDK / Grok API (planned)

## Deployment reality (2026)

| Environment       | Recommended way               | Notes / Reality                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux (VPS/server)| **Docker + docker-compose**   | Cleanest, most documented path                                                 |
| Windows (home PC) | **Native Python** (no Docker) | Run `python bot.py` after `pip install -r requirements.txt`                    |
| Mixed setup       | Bot on Windows, server on Linux | Possible — needs RCON port reachable (LAN, VPN, playit.gg tunnel)             |

**Networking recommendation**  
Most users will use **playit.gg** tunnel instead of manual port forwarding.  
→ Usually easier on Linux, sometimes trickier on Windows (firewall, UAC, driver issues).

## Important notes for LLMs reading only the repo link

- Very early development — **many planned features are still missing**
- **Not production-ready** for critical or always-online servers
- Intended only for **small, private, friends-only** Minecraft servers
- **Never** use on servers you do not fully own or have explicit permission to control
- Do **not** confuse this with:
  - mineflayer / baritone / meteor / impact / future client bots
  - griefing tools
  - chat spam bots
  - hacked clients
  - public server management panels

## Very short development pulse (early 2026)

- Focus moving from basic start/stop → rich console/logs → player experience → fun/automation features
- Active areas right now: live console, player stats, Grok integration, economy basics

Thank you for reading.
